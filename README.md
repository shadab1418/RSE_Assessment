## Assessment questions
It should take between 30 minutes and an hour to answer the questions. 

Please document your code files with question numbers so we can refer back to them. 

To share your results please create your own github repository containing your generated data and code files, then share this with **@rcfree**.

1.	How many male patients are present in the patient demographics?

2.	How many patients were extracted after 01/01/2015 

3.	Calculate the age in years of patients (using patient date of birth and todayâ€™s date) and determine the min, max, median and interquartile range.

4.	What percentage of patients have linked clinical data?

5.	Produce a CSV file named `num_clin_data_records.csv` with the headings `patient_id` and `num_records` containing the number of clinical data records present per linked patient which were recorded after 12/03/1980. 

6.	Using the files provided work out:
